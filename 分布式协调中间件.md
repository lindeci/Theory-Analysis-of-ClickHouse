## Consistency Guarantees

The consistency guarantees of ZooKeeper lie between sequential consistency and linearizability. In this section, we explain the exact consistency guarantees that ZooKeeper provides.

Write operations in ZooKeeper are linearizable. In other words, each write will appear to take effect atomically at some point between when the client issues the request and receives the corresponding response. This means that the writes performed by all the clients in ZooKeeper can be totally ordered in such a way that respects the real-time ordering of these writes. However, merely stating that write operations are linearizable is meaningless unless we also talk about read operations.

Read operations in ZooKeeper are not linearizable since they can return potentially stale data. This is because a read in ZooKeeper is not a quorum operation and a server will respond immediately to a client that is performing a read. ZooKeeper does this because it prioritizes performance over consistency for the read use case. However, reads in ZooKeeper are sequentially consistent, because read operations will appear to take effect in some sequential order that furthermore respects the order of each client's operations. A common pattern to work around this is to issue a sync before issuing a read. This too does not strictly guarantee up-to-date data because sync is not currently a quorum operation. To illustrate, consider a scenario where two servers simultaneously think they are the leader, something that could occur if the TCP connection timeout is smaller than syncLimit * tickTime. Note that this is unlikely to occur in practice, but should be kept in mind nevertheless when discussing strict theoretical guarantees. Under this scenario, it is possible that the sync is served by the “leader” with stale data, thereby allowing the following read to be stale as well. The stronger guarantee of linearizability is provided if an actual quorum operation (e.g., a write) is performed before a read.

Overall, the consistency guarantees of ZooKeeper are formally captured by the notion of ordered sequential consistency or OSC(U) to be exact, which lies between sequential consistency and linearizability.

## Linearizability

Linearizability (also known as Atomic Consistency or External Consistency) is a consistency level between strict consistency and sequential consistency.

For linearizability, suppose each operation receives a timestamp from a loosely synchronized global clock. Operations are linearized if and only if they always complete as though they were executed in a sequential order and each operation appears to complete in the order specified by the program. Likewise, if an operation’s timestamp precedes another, that operation must also precede the other operation in the sequence.

For example, consider a client completing a write at time point 1 (t1). A client issuing a read at t2 (for t2 > t1) should receive a value at least as recent as the previous write, completed at t1. However, the read might actually complete only by t3. Linearizability guarantees the read returns the most current value. Without linearizability guarantee, the returned value, current at t2 when the read began, might be “stale” by t3 because a concurrent write might happen between t2 and t3.

etcd does not ensure linearizability for watch operations. Users are expected to verify the revision of watch responses to ensure correct ordering.

etcd ensures linearizability for all other operations by default. Linearizability comes with a cost, however, because linearized requests must go through the Raft consensus process. To obtain lower latencies and higher throughput for read requests, clients can configure a request’s consistency mode to serializable, which may access stale data with respect to quorum, but removes the performance penalty of linearized accesses' reliance on live consensus.
